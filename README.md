# PolifunctionsSDK

A software development kit for implementing and using multi-valued mathematical functions (polifunctions) with applications in quantum computing, scientific computing, and formal verification.

## About the Project

PolifunctionsSDK is an open-source project that provides a formal framework for working with polifunctions - mathematical objects that extend the concept of functions to return multiple values simultaneously. Our goal is to create a robust ecosystem of tools that bridge the gap between theoretical mathematics and practical applications across different domains.

The SDK implements the theoretical framework introduced in ["Polifunctions: A Formal Framework for Multi-Valued Mathematical Functions"](https://osf.io/ywd4x_v1) (Bakalov, 2025).

## Key Application Areas

- **Quantum Computing**: Natural representation of quantum superposition and entanglement
- **Scientific Computing**: Elegant handling of singularities and multiple solutions
- **Formal Verification**: More precise reasoning about non-deterministic systems
- **Complex Analysis**: Simplified work with multi-valued functions

## Project Vision

The PolifunctionsSDK ecosystem consists of:

1. **Core Math Layer**: High-performance implementation of the mathematical foundations of polifunctions
2. **Language Libraries**: Implementations for Rust, C++, Python, and .NET
3. **Domain-specific Extensions**: Specialized libraries for quantum computing, scientific computing, and other fields
4. **Visualization and Analysis Tools**: For better understanding and working with polifunctions

## Current Status

The project is in the early stages of development. We are currently working on defining the basic interfaces and implementing core functionality.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you're interested in mathematics, computing theory, quantum mechanics, or any of the mentioned application areas, your help could be valuable.
