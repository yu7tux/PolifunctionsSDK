# PolifunctionsSDK Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the PolifunctionsSDK architecture, design principles, and component relationships.

## Design Principles

The PolifunctionsSDK is designed around the following core principles:

1. **Mathematical Rigor**: The implementation faithfully represents the formal mathematical framework of polifunctions.
2. **Performance**: Core operations are implemented in Rust for safety and performance.
3. **Cross-language Compatibility**: The SDK supports multiple programming languages through a common core.
4. **Extensibility**: The architecture allows for domain-specific extensions.
5. **Composability**: Components are designed to be composed and reused.

## Architecture Layers

The PolifunctionsSDK is structured in several layers:

### 1. Core Math Layer

The foundational layer implemented in Rust that provides:
- Basic mathematical types and abstractions
- Core polifunction traits and interfaces
- Implementations of different types of polifunctions (set-valued, interval-valued, etc.)
- Essential operations on polifunctions
- Foreign Function Interface (FFI) for cross-language support

### 2. Language Bindings

A set of libraries that expose the Core Math Layer to different programming languages:
- Rust: Native interface
- C++: For scientific computing and performance-critical applications
- Python: For data science, research, and quantum computing
- .NET: For integration with enterprise applications

### 3. Domain-specific Extensions

Specialized implementations for different application domains:
- Quantum Computing: Representations of quantum states and operations
- Scientific Computing: Numerical methods and scientific applications
- Formal Verification: Tools for formal reasoning and proof

### 4. Tools and Utilities

Supporting components for working with polifunctions:
- Visualization tools for exploring polifunctions
- Analysis utilities for studying polifunction behavior
- Interactive examples and tutorials in Jupyter notebooks

## Component Relationships

The architecture follows a modular design where:
- Each component has a clearly defined responsibility
- Dependencies flow mainly from higher layers to lower layers
- Cross-cutting concerns (like serialization, error handling) are addressed consistently
- Extension points are well-defined and documented

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation strategy focuses on:
1. Building the Core Math Layer first with a solid foundation
2. Developing the Quantum Computing extensions as the first domain-specific application
3. Creating basic language bindings for Rust, C++, and Python initially
4. Adding more domain extensions and language bindings over time
