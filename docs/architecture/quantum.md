# Quantum Extension Architecture

The Quantum Extension builds on the Core SDK to provide specialized implementations of polifunctions for quantum computing applications. It bridges the theoretical framework of polifunctions with quantum mechanics concepts.

## Key Components

### Quantum States

Quantum states are modeled as polifunctions:

- **QuantumState**: A specialized polifunction representing quantum states
- **Qubit**: Single-qubit state representations
- **MultiQubitState**: Multi-qubit state representations
- **MixedState**: Density matrix representations

### Superposition

The extension provides tools for working with quantum superposition:

- **Superposition**: Modeling superposition as set-valued polifunctions
- **AmplitudeFunction**: Associating amplitudes with potential outcomes
- **PhaseFunction**: Handling phase information in quantum states

### Quantum Operators

Quantum operators are implemented as transformations on quantum polifunctions:

- **UnitaryOperator**: Representation of unitary transformations
- **QuantumGate**: Common quantum gates (Hadamard, CNOT, etc.)
- **QuantumCircuit**: Compositions of quantum gates

### Measurement

Measurement is modeled as a specific type of operation on quantum polifunctions:

- **Measurement**: The measurement process as a polifunction transformation
- **ObservableOperator**: Quantum observables as operators
- **ProbabilisticCollapse**: Probabilistic nature of quantum measurement

### Entanglement

Quantum entanglement is modeled through specialized polifunctions:

- **EntangledState**: Representation of entangled quantum states
- **EntanglementOperation**: Operations creating entanglement
- **EntanglementMeasure**: Quantifying entanglement in quantum states

### Quantum Algorithms

Common quantum algorithms implemented using the polifunction framework:

- **GroversAlgorithm**: Implementation of Grover's search algorithm
- **ShorsAlgorithm**: Implementation of Shor's factoring algorithm
- **QuantumFourier**: Quantum Fourier Transform

## Integration with Quantum Frameworks

The extension provides integration with popular quantum computing frameworks:

- **QiskitIntegration**: Conversion between QuantumState and Qiskit's representations
- **CirqIntegration**: Conversion between QuantumState and Cirq's representations
- **PennyLaneIntegration**: Integration with PennyLane for quantum machine learning

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation strategy focuses on:

1. Defining quantum states as polifunctions that map measurement bases to sets of potential outcomes
2. Implementing quantum operators as transformations on these polifunctions
3. Modeling the measurement process as a special kind of composition
4. Expressing quantum algorithms in terms of these primitives

## Usage Examples

A simple example of using the quantum extension:

```rust
// Create a qubit in the |0⟩ state
let qubit = Qubit::new();

// Apply a Hadamard gate to create superposition
let h_gate = HadamardGate::new();
let superposition = h_gate.apply(&qubit);

// Measure the qubit
let measurement = Measurement::new(StandardBasis);
let result = measurement.apply(&superposition);

// Result is a probabilistic polifunction with 50% |0⟩ and 50% |1⟩
