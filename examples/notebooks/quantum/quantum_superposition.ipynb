    "In quantum mechanics, a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon known as superposition. Traditional mathematical functions struggle to represent this reality because they map each input to exactly one output. Polifunctions provide a natural framework for modeling such scenarios.\n",

    "3. Model the measurement process\n",
    "4. Visualize the probability distributions\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've demonstrated how polifunctions provide a natural and powerful framework for modeling quantum phenomena. The multi-valued nature of polifunctions aligns well with the superposition principle in quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways:\n",
    "- Quantum states can be represented as polifunctions mapping measurement contexts to sets of possible outcomes\n",
    "- Quantum operations (gates) are transformations of these polifunctions\n",
    "- Measurement causes the polifunction to collapse to a single-valued function\n",
    "- Entanglement can be modeled as correlations between the outputs of multiple polifunctions\n",
