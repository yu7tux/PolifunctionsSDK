# PolifunctionsSDK Interactive Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various aspects of the PolifunctionsSDK. These notebooks provide interactive examples, visualizations, and step-by-step explanations of core concepts and applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these notebooks, you need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- PolifunctionsSDK and its dependencies

### Installation

1. Install Jupyter if you don't have it already:

```bash
pip install jupyter

2. Install the PolifunctionsSDK and required dependencies:

pip install polifunctions-sdk matplotlib numpy

3. Launch Jupyter:

jupyter notebook

Usage Tips

Each notebook is self-contained and can be run independently
Code cells can be executed by selecting them and pressing Shift+Enter
Modify the code cells to experiment with different parameters and functions
The visualizations are interactive - hover over elements to see additional information
